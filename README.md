## Repository Structure

- **TWISTED_BILAYER_CRSBR**  
  This file includes the numerical computation of the magnon band structure, the moiré-modulated interlayer coupling and the ground state spin configuration of twisted bilayer CrSBr. Additionally, it contains the study of the spontaneous emission decay rate in the Markovian regime.

- **UNTWISTED_BILAYER_CRSBR**  
  This file contains the magnon band structure of untwisted bilayer CrSBr.

## Description

The project investigates the quantum magnonics properties of two-dimensional orthorhombic magnetic systems, specifically focusing on bilayer CrSBr materials. By using a first-order plane-wave expansion in the moiré superlattice, the code computes magnon dispersion relations both in untwisted and twisted bilayer configurations.
