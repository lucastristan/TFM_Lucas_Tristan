# Moiré Magnons in Twisted Bilayer CrSBr

This repository contains the code related to the Master's thesis on magnonic excitations in bilayer CrSBr (Chromium Sulfide Bromide) with and without twist angles, focusing on moiré magnetism and spin-wave theory.

## Repository Structure

- **TWISTED_BILAYER_CRSBR/**  
  Contains code, data, and scripts related to modeling and analyzing the magnon band structure and spin-wave excitations in *twisted* bilayer CrSBr systems with moiré superlattice effects.

- **UNTWISTED_BILAYER_CRSBR/**  
  Contains code and analysis for the *untwisted* bilayer CrSBr system, serving as the baseline model without twist-induced moiré phenomena.

## Description

The project investigates the quantum magnonics properties of two-dimensional orthorhombic magnetic systems, specifically focusing on bilayer CrSBr materials. Using bosonic Bogoliubov–de Gennes Hamiltonians and plane-wave expansions, the code computes magnon dispersion relations and band structures both in untwisted and twisted bilayer configurations. The twisted bilayer introduces moiré superlattice effects, enabling the study of flat magnon bands and potential "magic angle" phenomena.
